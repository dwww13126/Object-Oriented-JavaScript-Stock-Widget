# Object-Oriented-JavaScript-Stock-Widget

Project from COMPX322 Advanced Web Dev where we were tasked in creating a simple web app for allowing users to monitor weather data from a SQL database though using PHP and Javascript with AJAX. Stock data used in the Javascript is stored in object oriented form. Additions and fixes will be made to improve on the assignment version.
